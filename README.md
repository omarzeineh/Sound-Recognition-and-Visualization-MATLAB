# Sound-Recognition-and-Visualization-MATLAB
This project simulates a sound visualizer that records audio, displays the waveform, performs Fourier transform analysis, and visualizes the power spectrum. It calculates energy, power spectral density, maximum frequency components, and statistical features (mean, variance, standard deviation). Includes a GUI.
